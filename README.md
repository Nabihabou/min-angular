Minimal AngularJS Setup

## AngularJS
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) needs no introduction.

## Why?
- Most setups are bloated with unnecessary options.
- Start clean and minimal and extend as you go.

## Features
- Minimal functional Angular setup.
- Minimal testing example.

## Clone and install dependencies
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmitriz/min-angular
npm install --save
```

## Or install with `npm`
Create new directory:
```sh
mkdir new-directory && cd new-directory
```
Install the package:
```sh
npm init -y
npm install min-karma --save
```
That's it.

## Getting started
Run your tests:
```sh
karma start
```
Now try to edit files inside `src` folder and see how karma is watching and updating your test results.

Enjoy!
